# PocketBook 626 replace internal storage
Guide/general information about replacing internal storage in the ebook reader PocketBook 626 (Touch Lux 2) and other PocketBook devices
Since i didn't see a definitive guide that worked, i've decided to make one myself, so others won't have to go throught hours of torture like me.

## About the device

### Hardware
- PocketBook 626, and probably most of the other models except the very old ones use a micro SD card for internal storage (don't confuse it with the additional storage, that is also a micro SD card
  - As everyone knows, SD cards don't really live that long, and over time, they often die or become read-only. That means it deletes all the stuff you saved after shutting down the reader

### OS
- The device uses linux with very unstandard configuration to make our lives harder
- It has 10 partitions that look like this
  - _p1_ is the _main/user data_ parition where books and apps are stored, it's also the parition that shows up when you connect the reader to a PC
```

```
- The system checks serial number of the SD card, to check if the card is the original one, other systems also do this (GPS devices, kiosks, etc.)
  - So just cloning the whole image to another SD card won't work, if the CID does not match the original one, the reader just shows a sand clock at boot (or another error)

## What you need
- A computer, preferably with Linux. If you insist on using Windows, well, good luck
- Computer with internal SD card reader, or alternatively rooted android device with SD card slot
- Working micro SD card that is the same size or bigger than the original

## Guides

### Read CID (Card Identification Data) of an SD card
- Be aware that in order to correctly interact with a SD card, you need a device with embedded card reader. **USB readers can't read the cid**, since the computer sees the device as unspecified USB mass storage device
- It's easiest to do in Linux - `cat /sys/block/mmcblkX/device/cid` - replace X with the correct number (you can check with `lsblk`)
- On Windows, you'll have to use specialized apps, i don't have experience with that, so you'll have to find something yourself
- It's also possible to do in rooted android - You'll have to identify the correct disk number, most probably it's 1 because 0 is device storage
  - To execute the command either download an Android terminal emulator app or use [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb)
    - **How to do it with adb:** `adb shell`, `su`,`/sys/block/mmcblkX/device/cid`

### Read serial number of an SD card
- Read the serial in linux - `cat /sys/block/mmcblkX/device/serial`
- The SD_prepare app used in [this](#for-older-firmware-versions-edit-monitorapp) method also returns the serial number of card that's in the reader
You can also derive the cards SN from its CID
- CID look like this `824a544e4361726410c708e2ef00e801`
- Its SN looks like this `0xc708e2ef`
- By comparing the old CID with the new CID, you can derive the new correct serial like this
```
                   c708e2ef
824a544e4361726410 c708e2ef 00e801
02544d534130384714 1286ddca 00e601
```
- So the other serial will be `0x1286ddca`

### Create and write an image of the disk
- I've used `dd` for simplicity, and also because i'm lazy so i just copied what others did
- There's loads of alternatives for both Linux and Windows (like Win32DiskImager)
Create image - `dd if=/dev/mmcblkX of=/path/to/pocketbook_image.dd bs=512 conv=noerror,sync status=progress`
Write image - `dd if=/path/to/pocketbook_image.dd of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=512 conv=noerror,sync status=progress`

### Make the main partition larger
- Filesystem type is FAT32
- In order to do that, the partition has to be deleted and recreated, so **backup all contents of the parition** so you can later put them into the new partition
- Also, in my case. After booting up the reader with the resized partition, the device went into update mode. After the update, i couldn't open any of the books because of DRM protection. Those books were previously fine, others haven't reported anything like that
- I've used fdisk, since fdisk is the goat
```

## Methods
- There are multiple ways, but unfortunately, it varies for different firmware versions
- If any of these methods work and you used bigger card than the original, you can try to resize the main partition [like this](#make-the-main-partition-larger)

### Easiest method: Buy unlocked micro SD card
- This method is obviously firmware independent since you won't be altering the system
- Look up _unlocked CID micro SD_ or _custom CID micro SD_ or something along those lines. They are also sometimes called _coldcards_, mainly chinese sellers will pop up, but i've found a rather reliable seller from Europe - [zelemar.eu](https://zelemar.eu/)
- You can either buy card that will already ship to you with with your custom CID, or the CID can be changed with some software they provide
- When you have the new working card, just [write the image to it](#Create-and-write-an-image-of-the-disk) and you're good to go

### For older firmware versions: Edit monitor.app
This method has been patched for a long time, so it probably won't work

1. Download the SD_prepare.zip from [here]()
2. Extract it on the new microSD card
3. Insert the card into the e-reader using the external card slot
4. Start the device and execute the SD_prepare application (should be shown in the list of applications). This will create two files .sd_original_serial and monitor.app on the card
5. Remove the card and safe the two files somewhere else
6. Open the monitor.app in a hex editor (i used Ghex)
   - Search for this string `/sys/block/mmcblk%c/device/serial` - that's where the monitor.app gets the cards sn
7. Replace this string with /mnt/secure/.sd_original_serial
   - **This string is little shorter**, you can either pad the beggining with couple zeros or make file name longer, e.g. `/mnt/secure/.sd_original_serialll`, but you'll have to rename the file to match it
8. Save the modified file with the name _monitor_patched.app_
9. Mount /dev/mmcblkXp9 - `sudo mount /dev/mmcblkXp9 /some/folder`, and copy the file .sd_original_serial to it
10. Mount /dev/mmcblkXp8 - `sudo mount /dev/mmcblkXp8 /some/folder1`, and copy the file monitor_patched.app to it
11. In the directory in which you mounted partition 8 execute the following commands:

```
chmod a+x monitor_patched.app
mv pocketbook pocketbook_ORIG
ln -s monitor_patched.app pocketbook
```

12. Unmout the two partitions `sudo umount /dev/mmcblkXp8 && sudo mount /dev/mmcblkXp9`
13. Put the new card into the reader and see if it worked

### For newer firmware (2016) versions: Replace .freezestatus file
1. Find out CIDs of both the new and original SD card - [guide](#read-cid-of-an-sd-card)
2. Find out your readers serial number (YT123456..)
   - It's written on the inner side of the back cover
   - It's also written in _Settings->Info_ in the reader
4. Write the original image to the new card - [guide](#create-and-write-an-image-of-the-disk)
5. Mount partition 9: `sudo mount /dev/mmcblkXp9 /some/folder`
6. Download the _freezestatus_ tool from [here]()
7. If you're on linux, compile it by running `make` in the _Linux_ folder
8. In the serial folder, execute this `./serial --serial_number <ur serial number> --sd_serial 0x<ur sn>`
9. In the same folder, _.freezestatus_ file was created
10. Overwrite the _.freezestatus_ file in the mounted partition
11. Unmount the partition - `sudo umount /dev/mmcblkXpí`
12. Insert the card into your reader and enjoy
- Optionally, if you got bigger card, you can resize the partition [like this](#make-the-main-partition-larger)
